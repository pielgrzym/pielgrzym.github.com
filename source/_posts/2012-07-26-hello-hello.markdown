This is a hello world and some bits about myself:

* I'm a python (django, twisted) programmer
* I'm an admin and great Linux enthusiast
* I'm a shell junkie
* I'm crippled by tiling wm addiction
* I love to code in other languages in my free time: ruby, c, haskell
* I love good tools, mainly: vim, zsh, git and tmux - and others

This will be a strictly tech blog - about programming, linux and various tools.
Now this is akward. Let's move on to some more interesting stuff in other posts.
